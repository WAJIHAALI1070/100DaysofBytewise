Comparative Analysis of Clustering Techniques Across Datasets
Overview
This project performs a comparative analysis of K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering techniques on two datasets: Iris and Mall Customers. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementation of clustering algorithms, cluster visualization, and a comprehensive comparison of the results.

Datasets
Iris Dataset: This dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which includes three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Mall Customers Dataset: This dataset includes information about customers who visited a mall, with features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

Project Structure
The project is divided into the following tasks:

Dataset Selection and Initial Analysis:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each dataset to understand data distribution, feature correlations, and potential outliers.
Implementing Clustering Algorithms:

Apply K-Means clustering to both datasets and determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Apply Hierarchical Clustering to both datasets, choose an appropriate linkage criterion, and visualize the dendrogram to determine the number of clusters.
Cluster Visualization and Interpretation:

Visualize the clusters obtained from both K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE.
Compare clustering results qualitatively (e.g., cluster compactness, separation) and quantitatively (e.g., Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index).
Exploratory Analysis and Insights:

Analyze clusters in the context of the original features and interpret the clusters to identify patterns or insights (e.g., customer segments, species differentiation).
Explore the impact of different clustering parameters on the results.
Comparison and Reporting:

Compare the effectiveness of K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering across the two datasets.
Prepare a comprehensive article summarizing the findings, including visualizations, cluster interpretations, and a comparative analysis of the clustering techniques used.
