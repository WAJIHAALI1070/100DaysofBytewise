Problem Statement: AI-Powered Traffic Flow and Accident Prediction System
In today's fast-paced urban environments, managing traffic flow and minimizing road accidents are critical challenges. Traffic congestion leads to increased travel time and pollution, while accidents pose significant risks to public safety. Traditional methods of traffic management and accident prediction often lack the capability to adapt to dynamic real-time conditions and are limited in their predictive accuracy.

Objective
The goal is to develop an AI-Powered Traffic Flow and Accident Prediction System that leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to address these challenges. The system will predict traffic congestion and potential accidents in real-time by integrating historical traffic data and current weather conditions.

Major Components
Traffic Flow Prediction:

Approach: Implement a machine learning model, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to forecast traffic congestion. This model will be trained on historical traffic data collected from various sensors and cameras installed across the city.
Data Source: Historical traffic data including vehicle counts, traffic speeds, and sensor inputs.
Accident Prediction:

Approach: Utilize a deep learning model, possibly a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to assess the likelihood of accidents based on current weather conditions. This model will analyze factors such as temperature, visibility, and precipitation to predict accident risks.
Data Source: Real-time weather data including temperature, visibility, and precipitation levels.
API Integration:

Approach: Develop APIs using Flask to handle real-time data fetching, input weather conditions, and provide traffic congestion and accident risk predictions. These APIs will be essential for integrating with traffic management systems or mobile applications.
Functionality: The APIs will provide endpoints for retrieving traffic predictions, accident likelihood, and real-time weather conditions.
Deployment:

Approach: Deploy the trained models using TensorFlow and serve them with Flask. The models will be saved as pickle files to ensure they are reusable and easily integrable with various applications.
Infrastructure: Use TensorFlow for model deployment and Flask for API creation and integration.
