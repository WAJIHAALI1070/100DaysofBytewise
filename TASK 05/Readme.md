# 100DaysofBytewise Task05 - Machine Learning Tasks

This repository contains Python scripts (`.py` or Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb`) for solving machine learning tasks as part of Task05 for 100DaysofBytewise.

## Task01: Linear Regression Model for Predicting Housing Prices

### Overview
Implementing a linear regression model to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

### Expected Output
1. **Load the Dataset**
   - Load and prepare the Boston Housing dataset.
   
2. **Train a Linear Regression Model**
   - Implement and train a linear regression model using the dataset.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Print the model's coefficients and intercept.
   - Predict housing prices on a test set and print the mean squared error.
   
4. **Visualization**
   - Visualize the regression line and data points using matplotlib or any preferred visualization library.

## Task02: Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Flower Species Classification

### Overview
Building a decision tree classifier to classify iris flower species based on the Iris dataset.

### Expected Output
1. **Load the Dataset**
   - Load and prepare the Iris dataset.
   
2. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Implement and train a decision tree classifier using the dataset.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Print the classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the classifier's performance.
   
4. **Visualization**
   - Visualize the decision tree structure using graphviz or any preferred visualization library.
