# Machine Learning Tasks on Iris Dataset

This repository contains Python scripts (`.py` or Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb`) for analyzing the Iris dataset. The tasks cover various statistical analyses and visualizations using Python libraries.

## Task Overview

### Task 01: Mean, Median, and Mode of Sepal Lengths

- **Mean:** Calculate the average sepal length.
- **Median:** Find the middle value of sepal lengths.
- **Mode:** Identify the most frequent sepal length value.

### Task 02: Variance and Standard Deviation of Petal Widths

- **Variance:** Measure the spread of petal widths.
- **Standard Deviation:** Determine the average distance of petal widths from the mean.

### Task 03: Summary Table for Numerical Features

- **Summary Table:** Include mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Task 04: Probability Distribution of Sepal Lengths

- **Probability Distribution:** Define a random variable for sepal length and calculate its probability distribution.

### Task 05: Histogram of Sepal Lengths

- **Histogram Plot:** Visualize the probability distribution of sepal lengths using a histogram.

### Task 06: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Petal Lengths

- **CDF Calculation:** Compute the cumulative distribution function for petal lengths.
- **CDF Plot:** Visualize the cumulative distribution of petal lengths.

### Task 07: Probability Density Function (PDF) of Sepal Widths

- **PDF Calculation:** Determine the probability density function for sepal widths.
- **PDF Plot:** Visualize the probability density of sepal widths.

### Task 08: Probability of Petal Lengths exceeding a given value

- **Probability Calculation:** Determine the likelihood of a petal length exceeding a specified value.

### Task 09: Hypothesis Testing for Mean Petal Lengths

- **Hypothesis Test:** Perform a test to assess if there is a significant difference in mean petal lengths between two species of iris flowers.

### Task 10: Covariance and Correlation between Sepal Length and Width

- **Covariance:** Measure the joint variability between sepal length and width.
- **Correlation:** Assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between sepal length and width.
