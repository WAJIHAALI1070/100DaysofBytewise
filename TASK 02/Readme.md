# Python Tasks and Expected Outputs

This repository contains Python scripts (`.py` or Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb`) for various programming tasks. Each task focuses on different aspects of Python programming and problem-solving.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Palindrome Checker (Word)

- **Description:** Check if a given word is a palindrome.
- **Expected Output:** If the input is "racecar", the output should be "racecar is a palindrome." If the input is "Python", the output should be "Python is not a palindrome."

### Task 2: FizzBuzz

- **Description:** Print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
- **Expected Output:** See example output in the task description.

### Task 3: Nth Fibonacci Number

- **Description:** Find the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Expected Output:** If the input is 10, the output should be "The 10th Fibonacci number is 55."

### Task 4: Prime Number Checker

- **Description:** Check if a given number is prime.
- **Expected Output:** If the input is 7, the output should be "7 is a prime number." If the input is 10, the output should be "10 is not a prime number."

### Task 5: Guess the Number Game

- **Description:** Generate a random number for the user to guess.
- **Expected Output:** The program should guide the user to guess the number and provide feedback.

### Task 6: List Comprehension

- **Description:** Use list comprehension to create a list of squares of the first 10 integers.
- **Expected Output:** `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]`

### Task 7: Palindrome Sentences

- **Expected Output:** See examples in the task description.

### Task 8: Anagram Checker

- **Description:** Check if two strings are anagrams.
- **Expected Output:** See examples in the task description.

### Task 9: Reverse Words in a Sentence

- **Description:** Reverse the order of words in a given sentence.
- **Expected Output:** See examples in the task description.

### Task 10: Temperature Converter

- **Description:** Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **Expected Output:** See examples in the task description.
