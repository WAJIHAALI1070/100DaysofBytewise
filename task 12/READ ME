1. Predicting Employee Attrition Using Logistic Regression
   Dataset: HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
   Preprocessing Steps:
     - Handle missing values if any.
     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for department, gender, etc.).
     - Standardize numerical features.
   Task: Implement logistic regression to predict employee attrition and evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. Classifying Credit Card Fraud Using Decision Trees
   Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
   Preprocessing Steps:
     - Handle missing values if any.
     - Standardize features.
   Task: Implement a decision tree classifier to classify credit card transactions as fraud or not and evaluate the model using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix.

3. Predicting Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression
   Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset
   Preprocessing Steps:
     - Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing values with mean).
     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender, chest pain type, etc.).
     - Standardize numerical features.
   Task: Implement logistic regression to predict heart disease and evaluate the model using accuracy and ROC-AUC.

4. Classifying Emails as Spam Using Decision Trees
    Dataset: Spam Email Dataset
    Preprocessing Steps:
      - Handle missing values if any.
      - Standardize features.
      - Encode categorical variables if present.
    Task: Implement a decision tree classifier to classify emails as spam or not and evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Predicting Customer Satisfaction Using Logistic Regression
    Dataset: Customer Satisfaction Dataset
    Preprocessing Steps:
      - Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing values with median).
      - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for region).
      - Standardize numerical features.
    Task: Implement logistic regression to predict customer satisfaction and evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
