# Task 04

## Exercise 01: QuickSort Algorithm

### Description
The QuickSort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting an array. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

## Exercise 02: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

### Description
The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## Exercise 03: Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)

### Description
Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are algorithms for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

## Exercise 04: Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Description
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

## Exercise 05: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

### Description
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.
