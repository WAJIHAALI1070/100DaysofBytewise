# Iris Dataset Clustering Project

This project applies clustering algorithms to the Iris dataset, including K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Implementing K-Means Clustering:** Apply K-Means clustering to the Iris dataset and visualize the clusters using a scatter plot of two features. Evaluate the clustering by comparing it to the actual species labels.

2. **Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters:** Use the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters for the Iris dataset. Visualize the Silhouette Score for different cluster counts.

3. **Cluster Visualization with PCA:** Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the Iris dataset to two dimensions. Visualize the clusters obtained from K-Means clustering in the PCA-reduced space.

4. **Hierarchical Clustering: Dendrogram:** Implement hierarchical clustering using the Iris dataset. Plot a dendrogram to visualize the clustering process and choose an appropriate number of clusters.

5. **Comparing Clustering Algorithms:** Compare the performance of K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering on the Iris dataset. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach based on the results.

## Installation
