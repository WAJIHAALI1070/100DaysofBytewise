# 100DaysOfByteewise Task03 - Python Tasks and Expected Outputs

This repository contains Python scripts (`.py` or Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb`) for solving various algorithms and data structure problems as part of Task03 for 100DaysOfByteewise.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Recursive Factorial**
   - Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
   - **Expected Output:** If the input is 5, the output should be "The factorial of 5 is 120."

2. **Palindrome Linked List**
   - Write a program to determine if a given linked list is a palindrome.
   - **Expected Output:** If the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`, the output should be "The linked list is a palindrome." If the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, the output should be "The linked list is not a palindrome."

3. **Merge Sorted Arrays**
   - Write a function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array.
   - **Expected Output:** If the two input arrays are `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2, 4, 6]`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

4. **Binary Search Tree**
   - Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure, including methods for insertion, deletion, and search.
   - **Expected Output:** The program should be able to perform various BST operations and print the results.

5. **Longest Palindromic Substring**
   - Write a program to find the longest palindromic substring within a given string.
   - **Expected Output:** If the input string is "babad", the output should be "bab" or "aba". If the input string is "cbbd", the output should be "bb".

6. **Merge Intervals**
   - Write a program to merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.
   - **Expected Output:** If the input is `[(1, 3), (2, 6), (8, 10), (15, 18)]`, the output should be `[(1, 6), (8, 10), (15, 18)]`.

7. **Maximum Subarray**
   - Write a program to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given array.
   - **Expected Output:** If the input array is `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`, the output should be `6`, as the maximum subarray is `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.

8. **Reverse Linked List**
   - Write a program to reverse a singly-linked list.
   - **Expected Output:** If the input linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, the output should be `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

9. **Minimum Edit Distance**
   - Write a program to calculate the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another.
   - **Expected Output:** If the two input strings are "kitten" and "sitting", the output should be `3`.

10. **Boggle Game**
    - Implement a program that solves the Boggle game, given a board and a list of words.
    - **Expected Output:** The program should print all the words found in the Boggle board.
