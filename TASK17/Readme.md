# Mall Customers Clustering Analysis

This project applies clustering techniques to the Mall Customers dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The analysis includes K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction using PCA for visualization.

## Tasks Overview

1. **K-Means Clustering on Customer Segments**:
   - Implement K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
   - Visualize the resulting clusters.

2. **Optimal Number of Clusters**:
   - Use the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to find the optimal number of clusters for the dataset.
   - Criteria for selection include minimizing WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) and maximizing silhouette score.

3. **Cluster Profiling and Insights**:
   - Analyze the characteristics of the clusters formed based on their spending behavior and income levels.
   - Provide insights into customer segments.

4. **Hierarchical Clustering for Customer Segmentation**:
   - Apply hierarchical clustering and compare the results with K-Means clusters.
   - Discuss the differences and similarities between the two clustering methods.

5. **Visualizing Clusters with PCA**:
   - Use PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and visualize the clusters formed by both K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
