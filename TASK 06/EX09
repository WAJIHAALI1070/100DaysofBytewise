#Exercise 9: Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and print summary statistics for each column.
import numpy as np

# Generate 1350 random numbers
random_numbers = np.random.rand(1350)

# Print the first few numbers to inspect
print("First 10 random numbers:")
print(random_numbers[:10])  # Print the first 10 numbers

# Compute mean, median, and standard deviation
mean = np.mean(random_numbers)
median = np.median(random_numbers)
std_dev = np.std(random_numbers)

print(f"\nMean: {mean}")
print(f"Median: {median}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")
