#Exercise 06: Write a Python script to create a list of 10 numbers and compute their mean.
# Create a list of 10 numbers
numbers = [1, 4, 9, 109, 175, 230, 225, 3320, 3325, 4120]

# Compute the mean
mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

print(f"List of numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Mean of the numbers: {mean}")
