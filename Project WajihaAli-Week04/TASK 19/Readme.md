Comparative Analysis of Clustering Techniques Across Datasets

Task Description:

1. Dataset Selection and Initial Analysis:
Step 1: Choose two datasets from the list provided (Iris, Mall Customers, Wholesale Customers).
Step 2: Conduct an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each dataset to understand its characteristics, including data distribution, feature correlations, and potential outliers.

2. Implementing Clustering Algorithms:
Step 3: Apply K-Means clustering to both datasets. Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Step 4: Apply Hierarchical Clustering to both datasets, choosing an appropriate linkage criterion (e.g., single, complete, average) and visualizing the dendrogram to determine the number of clusters.

3. Cluster Visualization and Interpretation:
Step 5: Visualize the clusters obtained from both K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to help in visualizing the clusters, if necessary.
Step 6: Compare the clustering results qualitatively (e.g., cluster compactness, separation) and quantitatively (e.g., Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index).

4. Exploratory Analysis and Insights:
Step 7: Analyze the clusters in the context of the original features. For each dataset, interpret the clusters to identify any patterns or insights (e.g., customer segments, species differentiation).


5. Comparison and Reporting:
